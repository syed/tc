Many elections are decided by plurality voting, which means that
the winning candidate is the one who earns more votes than any other
candidate. Such elections are susceptible to the phenomenon of vote splitting. Several
candidates with similar views may draw support from the same voting base,
thereby losing to a single candidate who holds less popular views. One
remedy for vote splitting is a runoff election, where the field of
candidates is narrowed down through successive rounds of voting until
one candidate wins a majority of the vote.

</p><p>

The scheme known as instant runoff voting, or IRV, is intended to
accomplish the same result as a runoff election without incurring the
expense of multiple voting rounds. In an IRV election, each voter uses a
slip of paper called a ballot to rank the slate of <i>n</i> candidates
from 1 to <i>n</i>. The ballots are tallied as follows.

</p><p>

1. If one candidate is ranked first on more than half of all ballots,
this candidate is declared the winner.

</p><p>

2. Otherwise, the candidate with the fewest number-one rankings is
eliminated from all ballots, and each voter's ranking is adjusted as
necessary. If a voter ranked this candidate first, for instance, the
number-one rank on her ballot is now reallocated to her second-ranked 
candidate, and so on down the line. If several candidates are tied for
fewest number-one rankings, all of them are eliminated in this fashion.

</p><p> 

3. If no candidates remain, the election is declared void. Otherwise,
return to step 1.

</p><p>

For an election with <i>n</i> candidates, you are given a
string containing <i>n</i> distinct upper-case
letters, each of which represents a candidate. You are also given a
vector &lt;string&gt; encoding all ballots cast by the voting public. Each
ballot ranks the candidates from most favored to least favored. If
<i>n</i> is 5, for example, the candidates might be encoded as &quot;PQRST&quot;, 
and some voter may rank them on her ballot as &quot;SRTQP&quot;, signifying that she
ranks candidate S first and candidate P fifth. 

</p><p>

Tally the ballots as described above to determine the outcome
of the election. If the election is void, return an empty
string. Otherwise, return a single-character
string containing the candidate's code.
