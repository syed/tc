<html><head><title>CrossCountry</title></head><body  ><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td>You are the coach of a high school cross country team.  You are hosting a cross country meet at your school this weekend, and you need to be ready to score the meet.  Since it is a bit of a pain to do by hand, especially for large meets, you are going to write a program to do it for you.  Given the number of teams and the order in which the runners finish, determine the order in which each team places.<br></br><br></br>
Capital letters will represent the teams in <b>finishOrder</b> and in the return value.  The first team is 'A', the second team is 'B', and so on.  The place in which the five fastest runners on a team finish is added together (first place=1, second place=2, etc...), and that is the team's score (a team must have at least five runners finish to place).  Lower scores beat higher scores, and in the event of a tie the sixth fastest runners of each team are compared, and the team whose sixth fastest runner finished earlier wins the tie.  If two teams tie and only one has a sixth runner, that team wins the tie.  If two teams tie and neither has a sixth runner, the team who's letter comes first alphabetically wins the tie.<br></br><br></br>
You will be given an int, <b>numTeams</b>, which is the number of teams competing, and a string, <b>finishOrder</b>, which is the order in which the runners finish.  You are to return a string that lists the teams in the order they placed in the meet.  If a team has fewer than 5 runners finish, do not include it in the return value.<br></br><br></br>
For example, if <b>finishOrder</b>=&quot;AABBABBABBA&quot;, then team A's runners finish 1st, 2nd, 5th, 8th, and 11th, for a team score of 27 points.  Team B's runners finish 3rd, 4th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and 10th, for a team score of 29 points (notice that only team B's first 5 runners are scored).  In this case the return value would be &quot;AB&quot;.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>CrossCountry</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>scoreMeet</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>int, string</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>string</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>string scoreMeet(int numTeams, string finishOrder)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Notes</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>If a team has fewer than 5 runners finish, don't remove that team's runners from <b>finishOrder</b> before calculating the score of the other teams.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Constraints</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>numTeams</b> will be between 2 and 10, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>finishOrder</b> will be between 10 and 50 characters, inclusive.</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>finishOrder</b> will contain only the first <b>numTeams</b> capital letters ('A','B',...).</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>finishOrder</b> will not contain more than seven occurrences of the same character.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Examples</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" nowrap="true">0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td><table><tr><td><pre>2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>&quot;AABBABBABBA&quot;</pre></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><pre>Returns: &quot;AB&quot;</pre></td></tr><tr><td><table><tr><td colspan="2">The example from above.</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td align="center" nowrap="true">1)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td><table><tr><td><pre>3</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>&quot;CCCBBBBBAAACC&quot;</pre></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><pre>Returns: &quot;BC&quot;</pre></td></tr><tr><td><table><tr><td colspan="2">In this case team A does not qualify because only 3 of its runners finish.
